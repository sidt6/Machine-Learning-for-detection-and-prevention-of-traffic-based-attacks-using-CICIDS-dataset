# Machine-Learning-for-detection-and-prevention-of-traffic-based-attacks-using-CICIDS-dataset
The CICIDS dataset is a well-known and widely used dataset in the field of network security. The goal of this project is to develop machine learning models that can effectively detect and prevent traffic-based attacks by analyzing the patterns and characteristics of the network traffic data.
